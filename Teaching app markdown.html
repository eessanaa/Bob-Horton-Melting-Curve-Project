# 🧭 1. Overview

The **DNA Melting Teaching App** is an interactive educational suite designed to teach students and researchers how **DNA melting behavior** responds to sequence composition, salt concentration, temperature, and strain-level variation.  

Unlike the stand-alone melting simulators, this app is structured as a **guided curriculum** with:

- 🧩 **Four curated learning modes**  
- 🎓 Integrated **tutorial panels**  
- 📝 **Quick-check quizzes** inside every mode  
- 📊 Real-time melting curves, derivative plots, Tm estimation, and strain-matching tools  
- 🔬 Embedded “Foundations” notes explaining concepts as students interact  

This app delivers a complete, hands-on understanding of melting physics and its applications in **PCR analysis, variant detection, viral identification, and synthetic data generation**.

---

# 🔧 2. How the Teaching App Works  
<a name="how-it-works"></a>

The DNA Melting Teaching App contains **four structured learning environments**, each targeting a different aspect of melting analysis:

| Mode | Focus | Skills Learned |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Mode 1 — Intro to Melting Curves** | Single-sequence melting | GC%, Tm, derivative curves, ionic effects |
| **Mode 2 — Comparative Mode** | Reference vs Variant | ΔTm, sequence similarity, structural differences |
| **Mode 3 — Strain Identification** | Viral panel matching | Candidate ranking, cluster interpretation |
| **Mode 4 — Simulation & Dataset Mode** | Synthetic datasets | GC targeting, curve simulation, exporting CSV |

Each mode includes:

- a left-side **input panel**,  
- a dynamic **visualization panel**,  
- optional **tutorial steps**,  
- and a **quiz module** for quick comprehension checks.

The interface is consistent across all modes:

- **Temperature probe slider** → moves a vertical line through the melting curve  
- **Derivative toggle** → shows where melting occurs most rapidly  
- **Metrics box** → displays GC%, length, estimated Tm, fraction melted, and other mode-specific stats  

Each mode functions independently, but together they form a complete progression from simple melting physics → comparative genomics → viral identification → synthetic data generation.

# 🌡3. Mode 1 — Introduction to Melting Curves  
<a name="mode1"></a>
![](Mode 1.png)
> *Goal: Learn the fundamentals of DNA melting and how GC%, ionic conditions, and temperature shape the curve.*

---

## 3.1 Purpose of Mode 1

Mode 1 is a **concept builder**.  
Students begin with a single DNA sequence and learn:

- What a melting curve represents  
- How **GC%** shifts Tm  
- How **[Na⁺]** and **DNA concentration** influence stability  
- How to read the **derivative curve (dF/dT)**  
- How to identify approximate **Tm** interactively  

This mode is intentionally simple and visual, ideal for the first exposure to melting behavior.

---

## 3.2 Input Panel (Left Side)

### **DNA Sequence**
- Accepts A/T/G/C only  
- Automatically computes **length** and **GC%**  
- Sequence drives all calculations in both melting and derivative plots  

---

### **Conditions Panel**
Parameters:

| Input | Meaning | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **[Na⁺] (M)** | Sodium concentration | Higher Na⁺ → higher Tm |
| **DNA concentration (M)** | Strand concentration | Higher conc. → more duplex → ↑Tm |
| **Temperature probe (°C)** | Adjustable slider | Shows fraction melted at that temperature |

**Tip:** Increasing GC% or increasing salt shifts Tm **to the right** (higher temperature).

---

## 3.3 Visualization Panel (Right Side)

### **Fraction Melted vs Temperature**
A sigmoidal curve representing the transition from dsDNA → ssDNA.

Key features:

- Left flat region = fully dsDNA  
- Middle steep slope = **melting transition**  
- Right plateau = fully ssDNA  
- Vertical markers:
  - **Tm reference**  
  - **Current probe temperature**  

### **Derivative Plot (dF/dT)**
- Peak corresponds to the **temperature where melting occurs most rapidly**  
- The maximum (peak center) = approximate **Tm**  

---

## 3.4 Intro Metrics (Bottom)

Displayed values:

- GC%  
- Length (bp)  
- Estimated Tm (°C)  
- Fraction melted at current probe temperature  

---

## 3.5 Interactive Tutorial (Right Drawer)

Tutorial steps include:

1. Enter a DNA sequence  
2. Modify salt or DNA concentration  
3. Move the temperature probe slider  
4. Use derivative peak to identify Tm  
![](Mode 1 tutorial.png)
---

## 3.6 Quick-Check Quiz

Example question:

> **If GC% increases while [Na⁺] stays constant, what happens to Tm?**  
> ✔ Tm usually increases.

Students get immediate feedback before leaving the mode.
# 🧪 4. Mode 2 — Comparative Mode  
<a name="mode2"></a>

> *Goal: Compare a reference sequence and a variant, visualize ΔTm shifts, evaluate similarity, and understand how even small mutations alter melting behavior.*

Comparative Mode is the app’s first **multi-sequence analytical tool**.  
Students learn how changes in sequence composition influence:

- Melting curves  
- Derivative peaks  
- Tm values  
- GC% differences  
- Alignment identity  
- Practical consequences for variant detection  

This mode simulates what biologists do when comparing a **wild-type vs mutant**, or when evaluating **PCR amplicon identity**.

---

#  📚 4. Mode 2- Overview of Comparative 

When entering Mode 2, students see:

- Left panel → **Reference** (blue) + **Variant** (red) sequence input  
- Middle panel → Overlaid melting curves and derivative plots  
- Bottom panel → Comparative metrics  
- Right drawer → Tutorial and quiz modules  

This mode reinforces conceptual learning by making differences **visually obvious**.
![](Mode 2.png)
---

## 4.2 Optional File Upload (Teacher Feature)

Teachers may preload sequences using a `.js` file.

Example:

```js
"ATGCGT...", "GGGACT...", ...
```

## 4.3 Manual Entry of Sequences

Students may skip file upload entirely and type DNA sequences directly into the two provided fields:

- **Reference sequence (blue)**  
- **Variant sequence (red)**  

Both inputs accept:

- A/T/G/C only (case-insensitive)  
- Length ≥ 6 bp  
- Spaces or line breaks (automatically cleaned)  

Once entered, the app immediately:

- Recomputes melting curves  
- Updates the derivative (dF/dT) plot  
- Recalculates GC%, length, and Tm  
- Shows the new ∆Tm and percent identity metrics  

This allows students to explore how even small sequence changes affect melting behavior.

---

## 4.4 Shared Ionic Conditions

Both sequences use the **same solution conditions** to ensure melting differences arise *only* from sequence composition:

- **[Na⁺] (M)**  
- **DNA concentration (M)**  
- **Temperature probe (°C)**  

Because ionic strength and concentration strongly influence Tm, keeping these equal teaches proper experimental control.

---

## 4.5 Temperature Probe (Vertical Line)

A temperature slider controls a vertical probe line applied to *both* curves.

At the selected temperature, the app reports:

- Fraction melted (reference)  
- Fraction melted (variant)  

Students can observe:

- Which sequence melts earlier  
- How stability changes across the transition  
- Where curves diverge (AT-rich segments melt first)

---

## 4.6 Melting Curve Overlay

The main plot displays:

- **Reference curve (blue)**  
- **Variant curve (red)**  

The overlay highlights:

- Right-shifted curve → higher Tm → more stable  
- Left-shifted curve → lower Tm → less stable  
- Differences in cooperativity (slope steepness)  
- Whether mutations increase or decrease duplex stability  

Students visually connect sequence changes to physical melting behavior.

---

## 4.7 Derivative Plot (dF/dT)

The derivative curve shows the rate of melting:

- Peaks represent **Tm**  
- Broader peaks → gradual transitions  
- Narrow peaks → highly cooperative melting  

The app overlays reference and variant derivative curves to pinpoint ∆Tm accurately.

---

## 4.8 Comparative Metrics Table

Below the plots, the app computes:

- **GC% (ref / var)**  
- **Length (bp)**  
- **Tm (ref / var)**  
- **∆Tm (var − ref)**  
- **Percent identity**  
- **Fraction melted at the probe temperature**

These quantitative comparisons reinforce the connection between sequence composition and melting thermodynamics.

---

## 4.9 Tutorial & Quiz (Right Panel)

The teaching panel provides:

**Tutorial:**  
Step-by-step guidance for entering sequences, adjusting conditions, and interpreting curves.

**Quiz Time:**  
A multiple-choice question testing understanding of Tm behavior (e.g., effect of GC%).
---
This turns Comparative Mode into an interactive lesson on sequence-dependent melting behavior.
---

# 🦠 5. Mode 3 — Strain Identification Mode  
<a name="mode3"></a>

> *Goal: Match an unknown DNA amplicon to curated viral strain panels using melting curves, Tm shifts, and derivative profiles.*

Strain Identification Mode simulates a simplified version of **melt-curve genotyping**, commonly used in viral surveillance, diagnostics, and variant tracking.  
Students learn how melting behavior can differentiate closely related viral lineages—even when sequences differ by only a few nucleotides.

This mode integrates:

- curated viral strain libraries (e.g., **SARS-CoV-2 lineages**, **Influenza subtypes**)  
- unknown sample classification  
- melting-curve overlay comparisons  
- ranking and scoring tables  
- adjustable difficulty levels  

It provides a hands-on way to understand how computational melting analysis supports real-world pathogen identification.

![](Mode 3.png)
---

## 5.1 Strain Panel Selection (Left Panel)

Students begin by choosing a curated panel:

- **SARS-CoV-2 Lineage Panel (N gene amplicons)**  
- **Influenza A Panel (HA or NA fragments)**  

Each panel contains **multiple predefined sequences**, each behaving slightly differently under melting analysis due to:

- GC% variation  
- length variation  
- local stability differences  
- mutation patterns across viral lineages  

### Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Intended Use | Meaning |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Beginner (wide clusters)** | Intro learning | Only large ΔTm differences used |
| **Intermediate** | Moderate understanding | Clusters partially overlap |
| **Expert (subtle differences)** | Advanced users | Very small ΔTm shifts distinguish strains |

Difficulty modifies how “high-confidence” and “ambiguous” matches are described in the result tables.

---

## 5.2 Unknown Sample Entry

Students paste their **unknown amplicon** into the text field.

- Must contain A/T/G/C only  
- Automatically cleaned  
- Typical length ~20–200 bp (depending on panel)  

Pressing **Match Strain** triggers:

- melting curve calculation for the unknown  
- derivative curve generation  
- comparison to every strain in the selected panel  

---

## 5.3 Visualization Panel — Unknown vs Top Candidate

The top graphs display:

### **Fraction Melted vs Temperature**

- Blue curve → candidate strain  
- Red curve → unknown sample  
- ΔTm and alignment-level differences become visible instantly  
- Right-shifted candidate curve → more thermodynamically stable  

### **Derivative Plot (dF/dT)**  
- Peak positions show precise Tm differences  
- Peak widths indicate cooperativity  
- Overlaid peaks help students observe subtle strain distinctions  

The combined view teaches students how diagnostics use melting fingerprints rather than full sequencing.

---

## 5.4 Strain Matching Results (Bottom Panel)

After pressing **Match Strain**, the app generates a ranked table:

For each candidate strain:

- **Tm (candidate)**  
- **ΔTm (unknown − candidate)**  
- **Identity (%)**  
- **RMSD (curve similarity score)**  
- **Interpretation notes** (e.g., “Cluster overlap”, “Ambiguous”, “High-confidence”)  

Example ranking:

1. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1-like  
2. SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1-like  
3. SARS-CoV-2 Delta-like  
4. …

The student can see whether:

- multiple strains fall in the same cluster (“ambiguous case”), or  
- one strain clearly matches based on Tm and RMSD.

---

## 5.5 Interpretation Skills Developed

Students learn to:

- distinguish strains using **melting physics**, not full sequencing  
- understand **cluster behavior** across viral families  
- see how **Tm shifts accumulate** from small sequence changes  
- recognize **similarity vs differentiation limits**

This mirrors real laboratory decision-making in qPCR melt-curve assays.

---

## 5.6 Tutorial & Quiz (Right Drawer)

### Tutorial covers:

1. Choose a viral panel  
2. Paste unknown sequence  
3. Click “Match Strain”  
4. Analyze the ranked table  
5. Compare melting curves visually  

### Quiz Example

> **If two strains have nearly identical GC% and length, but their derivative peaks differ by ~0.3°C, what does this suggest?**  
> ✔ Subtle sequence differences still shift melting behavior.

This reinforces cluster-based variant identification logic.

---

# 🧬 6. Mode 4 — Simulation & Dataset Mode  
<a name="mode4"></a>

> *Goal: Generate synthetic DNA sequences, simulate melting curves under customizable conditions, and export datasets for R/Python/homework.*

Mode 4 transforms the app into a **dataset generator** suitable for:

- machine learning labs  
- curve-fitting training  
- student projects  
- synthetic controls for teaching  

Students gain complete control over sequence generation, GC targeting, curve simulation, and CSV exporting.

![](Mode 4.png)
---

## 6.1 Sequence Generator (Left Panel)

Students can produce **single synthetic sequences** by setting:

- **Length minimum (bp)**  
- **Length maximum (bp)**  
- **Target GC%**  

Pressing **Generate New Sequence**:

- replaces the current sequence  
- regenerates melting + derivative curves  
- updates GC%, length, and estimated Tm metrics  

Pressing **Preview**:

- keeps sequence unchanged  
- *only* updates melting behavior based on new conditions  

This teaches the difference between *sequence variation* vs *environmental variation*.

---

## 6.2 Conditions Panel

Parameters:

- **[Na⁺] (M)**  
- **DNA concentration (M)**  
- **Temperature probe (°C)**  

Students observe how environmental factors interact with GC targeting to shape melting.

---

## 6.3 Visualization Panel

### Melting Curve Plot  
- Shows the simulated curve  
- Displays Tm reference and probe position  
- Demonstrates how synthetic GC% affects stability  

### Derivative Plot

- Useful for teaching cooperativity and slope interpretation  

---

## 6.4 Synthetic Sequence Metrics (Bottom Panel)

Includes:

- final length  
- GC%  
- estimated Tm  
- fraction melted at probe  

These values demonstrate how close the generated sequence is to the target GC% and expected behavior.

---

## 6.5 Exporting CSV

Students can export:

- temperature series  
- fraction-melted values  
- derivative values  
- computed metrics  

This allows instructors to design:

---

## 6.6 Tutorial & Quiz

Tutorial steps explain:

1. Setting GC% and length range  
2. Adjusting Na⁺ and DNA concentration  
3. Generating vs previewing curves  
4. Exporting CSV  

Quiz questions reinforce GC%–Tm relationships and environmental effects.

---

# 📖 7. Glossary  
<a name="glossary"></a>

**Tm (Melting Temperature)** – temperature at which 50% of DNA is melted  
**Fraction Melted** – proportion of dsDNA converted to ssDNA at a given temperature  
**Derivative (dF/dT)** – rate of melting; peak indicates Tm  
**GC%** – proportion of G+C bases; increases duplex stability  
**RMSD** – root-mean-square deviation between two curves  
**Cluster** – group of viral strains with similar melting behavior  

---

# 🏁 8. Closing Notes  
<a name="closing"></a>

The **DNA Melting Teaching App** is a complete interactive system for understanding melting physics from first principles to advanced diagnostic applications.  
Across its four modes, students build intuition for:

- how sequence composition shapes stability  
- how to compare reference and variant amplicons  
- how melting curves can identify viral strains  
- how to generate synthetic data for scientific workflows  

In conclusion, the DNA Melting Teaching App brings everything together in a way that makes learning melting behavior a lot more intuitive. Instead of just reading about Tm or looking at static graphs, students can actually see how sequence changes, ionic conditions, and GC% all affect the curve in real time. The different modes also make it easy to connect basic concepts to real applications, like comparing variants or even matching viral strains.
It is both a teaching tool and a practical simulation environment for students to easily understand melting curves.
