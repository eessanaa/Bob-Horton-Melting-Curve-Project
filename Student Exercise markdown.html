# 🧬 **1. Overview** <a name="overview"></a>

This exercise introduces students to the fundamentals of **DNA melting behavior** and how melting curves are interpreted in molecular biology and diagnostics.  

Students will learn how DNA transitions from **double-stranded (dsDNA)** to **single-stranded (ssDNA)** with increasing temperature, and how melting curves are used in PCR analysis, high-resolution melting (HRM), variant detection, and DNA stability studies.

All curves illustrated in this exercise are generated using **nearest-neighbor thermodynamic models**, allowing clear conceptual learning without experimental noise.

---

# 🎯 **2. Purpose** <a name="purpose"></a>

This exercise helps students:

- Understand how melting curves arise from **thermodynamic DNA models**  
- Identify key melting curve features:
  - baseline  
  - transition region  
  - Tm (melting temperature)  
- Compare melting curves across:
  - short vs long DNA  
  - AT-rich vs GC-rich amplicons  
- Interpret derivative curves (–dF/dT)  
- Connect melting behavior to real-world applications in PCR and HRM  

---

# 🧪 **3. Exercise Scenario** <a name="exercise-scenario"></a>

You are assisting a new member in a virology or PCR workflow lab. They are struggling to interpret melting curves from both **real experimental runs** and the **simulator**.

Your job is to:

- analyze several melting curves  
- label key curve regions  
- determine Tm  
- compare short vs long DNA  
- compare GC-rich vs AT-rich amplicons  
- explain melting behavior in clear, simple terms  

By the end of the exercise, you should be able to accurately interpret melting curves for a wide variety of DNA sequences.

# 📚 **4. Background Concepts** <a name="background-concepts"></a>

## **4.1 What a Melting Curve Represents** <a name="41-what-a-melting-curve-represents"></a>

A DNA melting curve shows how a population of DNA molecules changes from **fully double-stranded** to **fully single-stranded** as temperature increases.

The simulator reports **Fraction Melted**, ranging from:

- **0.0 → fully dsDNA**  
- **1.0 → fully ssDNA**

Plotting Fraction Melted vs Temperature produces a **sigmoidal (S-shaped)** curve with three characteristic regions.

---

## **4.2 How Melting Curves Are Generated** <a name="42-how-melting-curves-are-generated"></a>

Melting occurs in three major stages:

### **1. Low-Temperature Baseline**  
DNA remains fully double-stranded  
Fraction Melted ≈ 0  

### **2. Cooperative Transition Region**  
Local regions begin to denature  
Melting in one region destabilizes nearby regions → steep slope  

### **3. High-Temperature Plateau**  
DNA is fully melted  
Fraction Melted approaches 1  

Underlying calculations use the **SantaLucia nearest-neighbor model**, which sums enthalpy/entropy contributions of adjacent nucleotide pairs.

---

## **4.3 Melting Temperature (Tm)** <a name="43-melting-temperature-tm"></a>

**Tm is the temperature at which 50% of the population is melted.**

- On the melting curve → Fraction Melted ≈ 0.5  
- On the derivative curve → corresponds to the **peak**

Higher Tm → more stable sequence  
Lower Tm → less stable sequence  

---

## **4.4 GC vs AT Melting Behavior** <a name="44-gc-vs-at-melting-behavior"></a>

GC content has a strong effect on stability:

- **GC base pairs (3 H-bonds)** → higher stability  
- **AT base pairs (2 H-bonds)** → lower stability  

Therefore:

- GC-rich sequences melt at **higher temperatures**  
- AT-rich sequences melt at **lower temperatures**  

---

## **4.5 Short vs Long DNA** <a name="45-short-vs-long-dna"></a>

### **Short DNA (<100 bp)**  
- Melts in one cooperative step  
- Single, smooth sigmoidal curve  
- One derivative peak  

### **Long DNA (>200 bp)**  
- Contains multiple regions with different GC content  
- AT-rich regions melt first  
- GC-rich regions melt later  
- Produces **multi-phase** melting  

Derivative curves may show **2 or more peaks**, each representing a melting domain.

---

## **4.6 Multiple Melting Domains** <a name="46-multiple-melting-domains"></a>

Longer DNA often melts in distinct phases:

- early melting of AT-rich domains  
- later melting of GC-rich domains  

This results in:

- multi-step melting curves  
- visible shoulders  
- multiple derivative peaks  

---

## **4.7 First-Derivative Curves (–dF/dT)** <a name="47-first-derivative-curves"></a>

Derivative curves highlight:

- where melting occurs most rapidly  
- approximate Tm  
- number of melting domains  

Short DNA → single sharp peak  
Long DNA → multiple peaks  

---

## **4.8 Factors Influencing Melting** <a name="48-factors-influencing-melting"></a>

Several conditions shift melting curves:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| ↑ Na⁺ | stabilizes dsDNA → ↑ Tm |
| ↑ Mg²⁺ | strong stabilization → ↑↑ Tm |
| DMSO / formamide | destabilize dsDNA → ↓ Tm |
| Mismatches | biologically lower Tm (but **not modeled** here) |
| Repeats/homopolymers | tend to melt more uniformly |

---

## **4.9 High-Resolution Melting (HRM)** <a name="49-high-resolution-melting-hrm"></a>

HRM can detect extremely small sequence differences (e.g., SNPs) by analyzing:

- subtle shifts in Tm  
- changes in curve shape  

Even a **single nucleotide change** may alter the melting curve.

---

# 🖼️ **5. Example Melting Curve** <a name="example-melting-curve"></a>

![Simulated DNA Melting Curve](melting_curve.png)

Key features illustrated:

- **flat baseline** at low temperature  
- **steep cooperative rise**  
- **high-temperature plateau**  

---

# 🧬 **6. FASTA Files Provided** <a name="fasta-files"></a>

The exercise includes several **FASTA files**, which contain DNA sequences used for melting-curve analysis:

- `influenza_HA_full_sequences.fasta`  
- `influenza_HA_amplicon_aligned.fasta`  
- `influenza_HA_amplicon_ungapped.fasta`  
- `clustalo-I20251201...aln-fasta`

These files allow students to:

- load real viral sequences  
- compare melting behaviors across strains  
- study GC% variation  
- understand how alignment affects melting  

FASTA format consists of:
>Header describing the sequence  
ACGTACGTACGT...

Students may use these sequences in Tasks 1–4.

# 📝 **7. Student Tasks** <a name="student-tasks"></a>

### **Task 1 — Visualize Melting Curves**
Plot melting curves for:

- **Sequence A (short, <100 bp)**  
- **Sequence B (long, >200 bp)**  

Label:

- low-temperature baseline  
- cooperative transition region(s)  
- Tm or derivative peaks  

---

### **Task 2 — Determine the Tm**
For each curve:

- identify temperature where Fraction Melted ≈ 0.5 (single-domain curves)  
- OR identify the major derivative peak (multi-domain curves)  
- compare Tm values across sequences  

---

### **Task 3 — Compare Short vs Long Melting Behavior**
Explain:

1. Why short DNA melts in one smooth cooperative step  
2. Why long DNA often has multiple melting transitions  
3. How derivative peaks correspond to distinct melting domains  

---

### **Task 4 — Compare AT-Rich vs GC-Rich Amplicons**

Given two melting curves:

- **Curve A → AT-rich amplicon**  
- **Curve B → GC-rich amplicon**  

Answer:

- which curve melts at lower Tm  
- which sequence is more thermodynamically stable  
- what sequence features explain the Tm difference  

---

### **Task 5 — Rule-of-Thumb Tm Estimates**
For a short DNA sequence (<100 bp):

1. Compute the simple estimate:
   **Tm ≈ 2°C × (A+T) + 4°C × (G+C)**  
2. Compare with an online calculator  
3. Compare both with the simulator’s Tm  
4. Explain why these values may differ  

---

### **Task 6 — Application Question**
Give one real-world use of melting curve interpretation, such as:

- verifying PCR product specificity  
- SNP detection  
- mutation scanning  
- allele discrimination  
- DNA stability assessment  

Briefly explain how melting behavior is used in that context.
