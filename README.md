# Bob-Horton-Melting-Curve-Project
## Overview

This repository contains an interactive educational project developed for the Bob Horton group to support teaching and learning of DNA melting curves. The project combines biological background, thermodynamic concepts, interactive simulation tools, and structured student exercises to help users understand how DNA sequence properties influence melting behavior.

The goal of this project is not only to simulate DNA melting curves, but to provide a **complete learning experience** that connects theory, visualization, and interpretation.

---

## Project Goals

This project was designed to help students:

- Understand the physical and biochemical basis of DNA melting
- Explore how sequence features (GC content, variants, length) affect melting behavior
- Visualize melting curves using interactive simulations
- Interpret melting curve features such as baselines, transition regions, and melting temperature (Tm)
- Connect computational models to real experimental reasoning

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several complementary components, each serving a distinct instructional purpose.

### Interactive Applications (HTML)

These files contain interactive, browser-based tools that allow users to explore DNA melting behavior dynamically.

- **Exercise App (ChatGPT).html**  
  Main interactive exercise app used by students to explore melting curves under different scenarios.

- **Teaching app markdown.html**  
  Instructor-facing version of the app designed to support guided demonstrations and explanations.

- **Student Exercise markdown.html**  
  Student-facing exercise version with prompts and structured interaction.

- **Simulator (app1) markdown.html**  
  Core melting curve simulator that generates curves based on adjustable parameters.

- **Tuner markdown.html**  
  Parameter tuning interface used to explore how model inputs affect melting behavior.

- **Tuner+dataset.html**  
  Extended version of the tuner that includes predefined datasets for comparison and exploration.

### Written Documentation (Markdown)

These files provide conceptual grounding, instructions, and context for using the apps.

- **Exercise Outline.md**  
  Defines the learning objectives, structure, and flow of the student exercise.

- **Melting_Curves_Background_Research.md**  
  Background research document explaining the biological and thermodynamic principles underlying DNA melting curves.

- **User Guide (App2).md**  
  Step-by-step guide explaining how to use the interactive tools and navigate the app interfaces.

- **README.md**  
  High-level overview of the project, its goals, and how the components fit together.

## How the Pieces Fit Together

1. **Background Research** introduces the science behind DNA melting.
2. **Interactive Simulators** allow users to visualize melting behavior.
3. **Student Exercises** guide learners through structured exploration.
4. **Teaching Tools** support instructor-led demonstrations.
5. **Documentation** ensures clarity, reproducibility, and ease of use.

Together, these components form a cohesive educational module that moves from theory → simulation → interpretation.

## Intended Audience

- Undergraduate students learning molecular biology, biophysics, or bioinformatics
- Instructors teaching DNA melting curves or thermodynamic modeling
- Learners interested in computational approaches to biological phenomena

---

## Educational Value

This project emphasizes **conceptual understanding over black-box simulation**. By allowing users to manipulate parameters and immediately see their effects on melting curves, the tools promote intuition, critical thinking, and deeper engagement with the material.

## Notes

All applications are designed to run locally in a web browser with no external dependencies. Simply download the files and open them in a modern browser.
